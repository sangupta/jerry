jerry
=====

`jerry` framework provides much of the common functionality that is used in a standard Java application like checking for application updates, providing template classes for CRUD operations with MongoDB, working with Quartz scheduler, and utility classes to work with HTML, cookies, JSON, XML, reflection, URIs, web and much more.

Features
--------
* Collection of utility classes
* Powerful HTTP framework for handling web requests
* MongoDB abstract class for writing CRUD operations on objects with single line of code
* Quartz scheduling framework
* Basic security framework classes
* Basic batching framework
* Added Base62 encoder for 64-bit integers

Builds
------

** 0.4.0 **

* Added a Jersey-Grizzly based un/blocking server that can be used to run services from given packages
* Added `UnsafeMemory` class and corresponding interface to allow for serialization using `unsafe` direct memory for performance reasons
* Added a `WorkerGroup` convenience class to launch multiple worker threads via a given class/instance/runnable factory
* Added an interface `HttpStatusCode` that defines various HTTP status codes
* Added method to `EmailAddress` class to parse multiple email addresses from a given string supporting the format `<full name> email@domain.com`
* Added many constants to `DateUtils` class


Downloads
---------

The library can be downloaded from Maven Central using:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sangupta</groupId>
    <artifactId>jerry</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Dependencies
------------

`jerry` depends on the following frameworks directly

* Apache HTTP client for web access
* Apache Commons IO for disk I/O
* Jericho HTML parser to work with HTML

Besides these, `jerry` also uses the following libraries (as in Maven `provided` scope) to provide utility functions and extension classes to remove boiler-plate code.

* Hibernate framework
* Spring ORM framework
* Java MongoDB driver
* Spring Data MongoDB
* Google GSON library
* XStream XML parsing library

The difference in `direct` and `provided` dependency stems from the fact on usage. For example, you will only use `HibernateUtils` class when using Hibernate in your project, and thus we don't declare that as a direct dependency. This helps us keep the size of the `jerry` library small.

Continuous Integration
----------------------
The library is continuously integrated and unit tested using the *Travis CI system.

Current status of branch `MASTER`: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sangupta/jerry.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sangupta/jerry)

The library is tested against

* Oracle JDK 7
* Oracle JDK 6
* Open JDK 7

Note: Build are not tested against `Open JDK 6` because of a compilation failure in code on generics. It does not seem to be a code issue as it passes on `Oracle JDK 6`. Will fix the error once I get to know more on the cause and its remedy.

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, 
`jerry` will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
